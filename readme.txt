we will discuss crud operations. create, read, update and delete. 
Express is framework for nodejs. NodeJS is JavaScript that run on server side.
we will learn First generate project with node js. second write first Express js project. then how to run 
server. how to create our routes. Next, roots to get all resources to get a specific resource by ID to delete
or update a resource 
we want to focus on express so we don't need to deal with any database configuration. we will have books and
we can get all books or get book by specific id or update title of book or delete book. 


Lec 2. Generating project with NPM. 
first install node js. write npm init command. give details. write author name and license as MIT. 
You can skip other details by simply just pressing enter. this command will generate package.json file. 
main file will be index.js and you can set your own main file by giving its name while npm init command
like app.js.  

After this install express by npm install express. if it does not add directly in package.json file then 
you can add it using npm install --save express. but new version add automatically. 


Lec 3. Setup and run express server. 
create app.js file that will hold our startup code for server. as we have made app.js our main file while 
instaling npm init.
